<h1>My Career Goals and Aspirations </h1>
  </head>
<p>It's hard to say where I'll be in say 5-6 years. I've realized that personal goals can change drastically in very short amount of time. I do however have an idea of what I'm aiming for.
  While I'm still early on in my computer science career, I can see myself working in either data science or backend software development.<br>
</p>
<h2>Data Science</h2>
<p>Working in data science involves using statistical and computational methods to extract insights and knowledge from data. This field involves a combination of skills such as programming, mathematics, statistics, and domain expertise.<br>
   Data scientists work on tasks such as collecting and cleaning data, building predictive models, and visualizing results to communicate their findings to stakeholders.<BR> 
    They often collaborate with teams from diverse backgrounds such as business, engineering, and design to solve real-world problems. The ultimate goal of a data scientist is to turn data into actionable insights that drive decision-making and improve business outcomes.</p><br>

  <h2>Backend Development</h2>
  <p>A back-end developer is responsible for building and maintaining the server-side components of web applications. They work behind the scenes to ensure that the front-end (user-facing) elements of an application function smoothly and efficiently.<br>
    This includes tasks such as writing server-side code, setting up and managing databases, and ensuring the security of sensitive data. <br>
    Back-end developers typically use programming languages such as Python, Ruby, Java, and PHP, and work closely with front-end developers, designers, and other stakeholders to bring a complete web application to life. <br>
    The work of a back-end developer is crucial for the success of a web application, as they play a key role in ensuring that it functions correctly and is able to scale to meet the needs of users.</p><br>
