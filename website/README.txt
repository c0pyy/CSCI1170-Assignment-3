Page 1/Homepage:

CSS Addition:
In assignment 2 I have added a form at the top of the page that allows the user to input their name and a window will pop up welcoming them 
to the website.


The first page of the website has the least amount of information and is mostly just visuals. 

What it does include though is link images, one to the dal.ca website and one to the dal faculty of computer science both linked to their own image.

The first page also includes a brief intro as to what the purpose of the website is and what it includes as well as an image of me with included ALT text.

(c:Drive/Desktop/Website/index)


Page 2/About Me:

CSS Addition:

Added flexbox as a styling element and updated list styles.


The second page is an about me section. This includes a little bit about me and my life, also includes some more images with alt text. 

Included at the bottom of the page are an onordered list as well as a ordered list.

(c:Drive/Desktop/Website/page1)

Page 3/Career:

CSS Additon: Updated table to include css styling.

The third page is about future career aspirations and goals. This includes a description of two careers that I could see myself going into as well as videos.

I used the iframe function to directly link youtube videos about the two career paths.

At the bottom of the page there is a table that outlines different potential careers within each of the mentioned fields.

Page 4/Travel and Photos:

CSS Addition: 
Adjusted images to have rounded edges.

The fourth page is strictly images and videos. 

The important aspect of this page is the included video file as the prior videos were both external links.

This page consists of travel photos and videos.

Navigation:

CSS Addition: Added visual elements to the top navigation bar.

The user navigates through the pages using the navigation bar in the top left of the page.

The nav bar includes links to each page's individual HTML file.

The nav bar is included within each HTML file, therefore the user is able to navigate back and forth from one page to another.

This function is achieved by using the "<a href=" function with an included link to the page and title of the said page. 



Assignment 3 Additions:

Added additonal staring page that includes a hero image and a welcome message as well as a color changing button that navigates to the main page.

Added form and alert function that creates personilzed welcome pop up to the user.

Added colour changing font on index page.

Added both mobile and tablet views to each webpage.
